Extracting survival-relevant subnetworks from multi-scale omics data.

### Files description

-The file Module_MMAS.py contains the functions needed for the computation.

-The file Script_MMAS.py contains the code with the upload of the data and and the evaluation of the functions in Module_MMAS.py.

-The file Simulate.py contains the code that can be used to simulate new data.


The two file .csv are the matrix with simulated data (PPI of 50 nodes, 20 observations):
-gxSIM.csv is the matrix with gene expression data, survival data and censor information;
-netSIM.csv is the adjacency matrix of the scale-free simulated PPI network.
